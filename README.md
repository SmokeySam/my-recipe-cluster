## UX/UI  
### Planes Of Scope

1. Stratagy Plane
* I Focused on what the user usually questioned when asking about a recipe and the main inforation included in the average recpie and that the application would cater for their needs and wants. 

2. Scope Plane
* I thought of the features and usuabilty of the applcation and how it would help the user in creating and storing their recipes.

3. Structure Plane
* At this stage of the porject after going through the features I wanted on the application, I started designing the structure of the applcation and what pages it would need.

4. Skeleton Plane
* After selecting the pages and designing the flow of the application, I started visualizing the layout, buttons, colors and fonts that would appeal to the user.

5. Surface Plane
* Bringing all the other stages together I started building the project and adjusting to changes and new implements on the way.

### Features

1. **Navbar**

* The navbar is made up of 5 Links : Clickable Logo, All Recipes, My Recipes, Add Recipes, Resources.
When logged in "Log Out" is displayed in the navbar. When not logged in we have a "Sign up" and "Log In" links also
displayed in the navbvar. I chose green for the color of the navbar as it is the colour symolized with health and also most fresh produce "Eat your greens".

* I also added a mobile navabr for use on other divices.

2. **Images**

* I used images with alot of colour to entise the user. The images show different types of meals and alot of fresh ingredients.
I thought these images fitted my idea and what I was trying to bulid. They may also inspire the user to use fresher produce.

3. **Recipe Forms**

* One of the main features of the application is storing the recipes information. The form consits of numorous fields which the user can add different information about the recipe such as :
Cusine, Type, Ingredients and more. The from appears on both the "Add Recipe Page" and "Edit Recipe Page.

4. **Search Box**

* The search box allows user to search recipe by : Name, Cuisine and type of meal.

5. **Collapsible Recipe List**

* The collapsible recipe list shows user the recipes that have been added to the application along with another collapsible recipe list on the users profile page.
The list on the users page is just the recipes they have created themselves. The collapsible also has a delete and edit button, onll available to the user who created them.

6. **Resources Page**

* The recources page has links to various blogs, YouTube channels, books, equipment and ingredient sites I thought the user would enjoy or benefit from.

7. Sign Up, Login, Logout

* Other features of my application are been able to register as a user and log in and log out of your profile.

### Design & Visual

1. **Fonts & Color**

* I imported "Itim" from Google Fonts to use as my primary font and have "sans-serif" as my backup.
I liked the simplicitly in the sytling. It is also reasy to read.

* For my headers on the pages i picked green as the colour again to match with my Navbar.

* Paragraphs are in black color. I feel black is such a neautral colour and people are accustomed to seeing it.
Also its very easy to read.

* The background color of my pages is white. As it makes the features of the webpage stand out. Also it works well for readability with the black text
of my paragraphs.

2. **Icons**

* I Used icons while makes my recipe forms and also the sign up, login and logout pages. I used icons in which the field the user was using to was relative to what it was.

3. **Structure**

* The overall layout and structure is relatively simple. I focused on the user been able to user the application for its intended purpose. Straight to the point.
My pages with user content consist of a header follwed by an image. Below the image is a short sentance or paragraph explaing what the page does. Below then it the main feauture or purpose of the page.

### Wireframes

## Technologies Used

1. **Languages**

* I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery as my front end languages.

* I used Python & Flask as my backend languages.

2. **Database**

* I used MONGDB as my database.
