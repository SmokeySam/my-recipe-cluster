## UX/UI  
### Planes Of Scope

1. Stratagy Plane
* I Focused on what the user usually questioned when asking about a recipe and the main inforation included in the average recpie and that the application would cater for their needs and wants. 

2. Scope Plane
* I thought of the features and usuabilty of the applcation and how it would help the user in creating and storing their recipes.

3. Structure Plane
* At this stage of the porject after going through the features I wanted on the application, I started designing the structure of the applcation and what pages it would need.

4. Skeleton Plane
* After selecting the pages and designing the flow of the application, I started visualizing the layout, buttons, colors and fonts that would appeal to the user.

5. Surface Plane
* Bringing all the other stages together I started building the project and adjusting to changes and new implements on the way.

### Features

1. Navbar

* The Navbar is made up of 5 Links : Clickable Logo, All Recipes, My Recipes, Add Recipes, Resources.
When logged in "Log Out" is displayed in the Navbar. When not logged in we have a "Sign up" and "Log In" links also
displayed in the Navbvar. I chose green for the color of the Navbar as it is the colour symolized with health and also most fresh produce "Eat your greens".

* I also added a Mobile Navabr for use on other divices.

2. Images

* I used images with alot of colour to entise the user. The images show different types of meals and alot of fresh ingredients.
I thought these images fitted my idea and what I was trying to bulid. They may also inspire the user to use fresher produce.

3. Recipe Forms

4. Search Box

5. Collapsible Recipe List

6. Resources Page

7. Sign Up, Login, Logout

### Design 

1. Fonts & Color

* I imported "Itim" from Google Fonts to use as my primary font and have "sans-serif" as my backup.
I liked the simplicitly in the sytling. It is also reasy to read.

* For my headers on the pages i picked green as the colour again to match with my Navbar.

* Paragraphs are in black color. I feel black is such a neautral colour and people are accustomed to seeing it.
Also its very easy to read.
